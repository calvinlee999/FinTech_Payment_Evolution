# 🚀 Cross-Machine Development Guide

## ✅ Repository Successfully Committed!

Your Golden Path template is now available at:
**https://github.com/calvinlee999/react_next_java_journey**

## 💻 Setup on Any New Machine

### 1. One-Command Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/calvinlee999/react_next_java_journey.git
cd react_next_java_journey
./setup-dev-env.sh && ./start-dev.sh
```

### 2. What Happens Automatically
- ✅ Clones the complete project
- ✅ Installs all frontend dependencies (npm)
- ✅ Resolves all backend dependencies (Maven)
- ✅ Validates Java and Node.js versions
- ✅ Starts both frontend and backend servers
- ✅ Opens development URLs automatically

### 3. Instant Verification
After setup, these URLs will be ready:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8080
- **Examples**: http://localhost:3000/examples

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development (from project root)
./start-dev.sh

# Stop development (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Automatically stops both frontend and backend
```

### Making Changes
```bash
# Standard git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push

# On other machines
git pull  # Get latest changes
./start-dev.sh  # Continue development
```

### VS Code Integration
```bash
# Open project with all configurations
code .

# Available VS Code tasks:
# - Start Frontend (Ctrl+Shift+P -> Tasks: Run Task)
# - Start Backend
# - Build Project
# - Run Tests
```
