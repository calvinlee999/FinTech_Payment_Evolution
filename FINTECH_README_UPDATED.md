- Machine learning-driven risk assessment and fraud detection
- Predictive analytics for market trends and customer behavior
- Natural language processing for document analysis and compliance

### **2. ü§ñ Agentic Business Workflow Automation with MCP**
- Autonomous business process orchestration using Model Context Protocol
- Intelligent workflow optimization and exception handling
- Cross-system integration with intelligent routing and decision logic
- Self-healing and adaptive workflow management

### **3. üîÑ Agentic End-to-End Development to Deployment**
- Automated feature development from requirements to production
- Micro frontend to microservice architecture implementation
- Strangler pattern integration for legacy system modernization
- Domain-based MCP, API, and Data as Product/Data Mesh architecture
- AI-driven code generation, testing, and deployment automation
