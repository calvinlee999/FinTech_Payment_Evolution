# Analytics Sequence Diagrams

This document contains comprehensive sequence diagrams for the FinTech AI Platform's analytics workflows, demonstrating real-time and batch processing patterns following Microsoft Azure architecture styles and Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Azure Architecture Integration

Our analytics workflows implement Microsoft Azure's recommended patterns for:
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time data processing with Azure Event Hubs and Stream Analytics
- **Big Data Architecture**: Scalable batch processing with Azure Databricks and Synapse Analytics  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decoupled analytics services with API Gateway and service mesh
- **IoT Architecture**: Device data ingestion and processing with Azure IoT Hub and Time Series Insights
