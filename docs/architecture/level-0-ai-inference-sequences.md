## 🎯 Key Performance Indicators

### Response Time Targets by Use Case

| Use Case | Target Response Time | SLA | Typical Volume |
|----------|---------------------|-----|----------------|
| Fraud Detection | < 100ms | 99.9% | 10,000/min |
| Customer Service | < 100ms | 99.5% | 5,000/min |
| Credit Risk Assessment | < 1s | 99.0% | 1,000/hour |
| AML Monitoring | < 1s | 99.5% | 50,000/day |
| Portfolio Stress Testing | < 30min | 100% | 1/month |
| CECL Calculation | < 4hrs | 100% | 1/quarter |

### Security Requirements

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data in transit and at rest
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify every request
- **Audit Logging**: Complete transaction trails
- **Regulatory Compliance**: SOX, Basel III, GDPR, PCI DSS
- **Incident Response**: < 15 minutes detection to response
