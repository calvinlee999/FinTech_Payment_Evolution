ISO 20022 Market Guidance
January 2025 version 2.0

Introduction
In 2020, the Payments Market Practice Group sponsored an
initiative to produce payments market guidance for specific,
agreed payments use-cases. The work group had the mission to
create global ISO 20022 Market Practice and Implementation
Guidelines in order to ensure a common implementation of ISO
20022 for the agreed payment use-cases.
The work compliments the ISO 20022 harmonisation initiative
and will align with and build from the HVPS+ and CBPR+
implementation guidelines as the basis to ensure end-to-end
processing without data loss.
This payments market practice will define, for the specified usecases, how ISO 20022 messages are to be validated and used
on the SWIFT network. This work aims to encourage the use of
new data elements in the ISO 20022 message, and to enable
consistent usage of those elements internationally. This work will
deliver documented and agreed market guidance for the
specified use-cases.
As a further deliverable, the working group will define and agree
the ownership for the guidance on an on-going operational basis,
with robust and transparent governance processes for version
management and maintenance of these usage guidelines.
The Payments Market Practice Working Group will operate
through successive phases, each phase defined by the set of
use-cases that are to be addressed, and each phase will be
agreed with PMPG in advance of commencing.

Remittances Use-Case: Introduction
Remittances are defined as payments between two natural persons
(P2P for short) and are separate and distinct from business to person
or government to person payments.
Our work on the Remittances use-case has considered 5 specific
Remittances use-cases

• 1a: bank account to bank account
• 1b: bank account to cheque
• 1c: bank account to cash
• 1d: bank account to digital wallet
• 1e: bank account to payment card
For each of these specific use cases, there is a repeating pattern of 3
slides:

•
Macro benefits for this Use-case
• $717bn of remittances sent globally, 76% went to Low/Middle
Income Countries (2019). >10% of world population are recipients
• Average global remittance cost is currently 6.7% - more than 2x 3%
target set in the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030
• Steps to reduce frictions in remittance payments will promote
competition across PSPs and reduce associated costs.
• Clearer identification of payments and standardisation of ISO
messages conventions could result in more efficient payments

Industry Sectors involved: incl. primary ‘end users’

Account to (Card) Account Payments
• Both the debtor and creditor are persons and not legal
entities
• The transfer takes place cross-border but the creditor has
advised the debtor to direct the payment to a card
account. This card number can be associated with a DDA
account (e.g. debit card), a pre-paid card account or a
credit card account.
• The account can be in the currency of the payment or a
different currency.

Codewords (immutability)
• Category Purpose Code indicating remittance transactions
• Purpose Code to indicate a sub-type

Workers Remittance, Private banking, Overseas banking,
Non-resident banking

Party Data
• Structured address data
• Additional party identification in structured form: DOB,
Place of Birth
Fee and FX Rate Transparency
Confirmation that account has been credited

End User
• Debtor: Individual with a bank account
• Creditor: Individual that has identified its bank relationship
via a card number.

Conclusions/ Recommendations
Challenges in providing Guidance for the Use Case

Target Benefits (from effective market guidance)
Debtor
• Transparency of fees and rates
• Traceability
• Completion Alert when the account has been credited
• Low likelihood of misrouted payments (payment accuracy)
Creditor
• Clarity who the payment is from
• Transparency of fees
Agents
• Reduced investigation costs
• Improved product effectiveness will increase usage to
compete with non-bank providers

PMPG - ISO 20022 Market Guidance

Debtor Agent
• Front Ends will need to be modified including systems in
branches
• Needs to look up the bank id/clearing code based on the card
number
Intermediary Agent
• Has to support the interface to the card networks
• Translate the card network responses into a pacs.002

Examples of types of Payment Provider involved (bank &
non-bank)
Banks
• That are willing to support switching push payments to the
card network.

The following data characteristics represent this use case
• Clearing Code (ClrSysId): new codes could be created to
indicate card networks like MCNET, VCNET, AXNET
Purpose: No ExternalClearingSystemIdentification1Code
exits today to allow the specification of a card network in
the clearing code element
• Category Purpose Code (CtgyPurp): GP2P
• Purpose Code (Purp): GIFT
Should the payment be subsequently returned (pacs.004) the
following Return Reason codes may be considered
• Card number invalid (AC16) to communicate to the
instructing agent or the tracker that the account proxy is
invalid (no new code if acct id)
CdtrAcct ID should be used for the card number

PMPG - ISO 20022 Market Guidance

22

Introduction: Securities Settlement Payments
As a Receiving Agent of a confirmed security purchase, a payment
obligation concludes the transaction.
Two common use cases exist for Securities Settlement-related
payments, to address the payment obligation.
• Versus Payment to a Central Security Depository (CSD) which either
settles an individual security obligation or a consolidated number of
security obligations.
• Delivery-free – Payment to the Broker (Delivery Agent) for the
individual security obligation, commonly referred to as ‘delivery free
of payment’.
The detail slides for each case set out
• use-case description
• example scenario
• examples of key data elements

Summary: Versus Payments – to Central Security Depository (CSD)
Description of Use-Case

Call for Action

Specific Recommendations for market Guidance

Versus Payments to a Central Security Depository
(CSD) which either settles an individual security
obligation or a consolidated number of securities
obligations.
(see slides 6-8 for detail)

Owner: Securities Market Infrastructures
❑ Document payment message data requirements
publicly, using tools such as MyStandards (C1)

For this use case
➢ PMPG recommends all parties use a pacs.009
message type with the category purpose code
SECU (R1)

Opportunities / Current Issues
ISO 20022 enables key data to be included in
securities settlement-related payments in a structured,
standardised way, and to meet various jurisdictional
requirements
• payment purpose
• party identifications
• reference data (e.g. ISIN)
Current practice, in a number of cases, involves
proprietary (non-standardised) codes or identifications

❑ Drive awareness and usage of existing ISO 20022
external Purpose Codes (C2)
❑ Where required, define and register additional
codes (C2a)
❑ Register additional Party Identification Schemes
with ISO 20022 (C3)

Owner: Payments Market Infrastructures
❑ Upgrade the usage guidance to capture the full set
of data needs for a securities settlement-related
payment (…as defined within the Security Market
Infrastructure payment Usage Guideline) (C4)

Payment settlement is not optimised to capture the
data needs of securities payments
There is insufficient awareness and availability of
guidance for securities settlement-related payments

PMPG - ISO 20022 Market Guidance

Summary: Delivery free – Payment to the Broker
Description of Use-Case

Call for Action

Specific Recommendations for Market Guidance

Delivery-free – Payment to the Broker (Delivery
Agent) for the individual security obligation, commonly
referred to as ‘delivery free of payment’.
(see slides 9-12 for detail)

Owner: Securities Market Infrastructures
❑ Document payment message data requirements
publicly, using tools such as My Standards (C1)

For the pacs.008 or pacs.009 message:
➢ Use Category Purpose: SECU, together with
additional element Charge Bearer, defines a dedicated
charge practice. (R2)

Opportunities / Current Issues
ISO 20022 enables key data to be included in securities
settlement-related payments in a structured, standardised
way, and to meet various jurisdictional requirements
• payment purpose
• party identifications
• reference data (e.g. ISIN)
The ‘purpose’ of payment may be required for certain
jurisdictions. Although standardised ISO 20022 Purpose
Codes exist, proprietary codes are often used, which may:
• vary in format
• be duplications in different use cases
• may not be publicly available.
Identification of the Creditor may have jurisdictional
specificities.
Reference information to accompany the payment is
important in many cases. Often the International Securities
Identification Number (ISIN) is needed.

PMPG - ISO 20022 Market Guidance

❑ Drive awareness and usage of existing ISO 20022
external Purpose Codes (C2)
❑ Where required, define and register additional
codes (C2a)
❑ Register additional Party Identification Schemes
with ISO 20022 (C3)

Owner: Payments Market Infrastructures
❑ Upgrade the usage guidance to capture the full set
of data needs for a securities settlement-related
payment (…as defined within the Security Market
Infrastructure payment Usage Guideline) (C4)

For Purpose Code:
➢ ISO 20022 external codes should be used. (R3)
Where additional code are required, an ISO 20022
external code list Change Request should be
submitted.
For Creditor Information
➢ Creditor can be identified with a number of existing
ISO 20022 data elements. Preference is to use BIC or
LEI. (R4)
➢ Jurisdictional forms of identification can be captured
within the Other/Identification with the Scheme
Name. Both should be registered with ISO 20022 as a
Change Request so that the format of the identification
and the scheme it belongs to are defined. (R5)
For Remittance Information
➢ The International Securities Identification Number
(ISIN) can be captured in either unstructured format
preceded by ‘ISIN’ and separated with a space; or as
structured remittance information with the code ISIN
in the Referred Document Information / Type / Code
element. (R6)

Securities Settlement Payment: Versus Payments – to Central Security Depository (CSD)
Description of Use-Case
Versus Payment to a Central Security Depository (CSD)
which either settles an individual security obligation or a
consolidated number of securities obligations.

Target Benefits (from effective market guidance)
The securities industry, like many other users of payments,
looks forward to experiencing;
• greater payment predictability in relation to timely
settlement and charges.
• richer reference data and party identification (such as the
Legal Entity Identifier),
Both of which provide greater transparency and efficiency in
areas such as reconciliation for the whole financial
ecosystem.

PMPG - ISO 20022 Market Guidance

Opportunities from Standardisation and Richer Data for
Securities Payment.

support the instruction priority and category purpose. These
two elements will need to be made available

CCP as Creditor
• Timely execution of payment
• Tracking
• Apply payment automatically to the correct obligation
CCP Member as Debtor
• Not failing a margin call
• Not comingling client and house obligations
• tracking
Agent
• Easy identification of margin call in stress situations

New external codes needed
• Category Purpose Code (CtgyPurp): CCPP
Rational: Currently no ExternalCategoryPurpose1Code is
available to indicate a central counterparty settlement
• Purpose Code (Purp): CCPC, CCPM, CCSM

Market Guidance: Use-Case FMI Settlements: 2. CCP Margin Payments via direct settlement
Description of Use-Case

Opportunities from Standardisation and Richer Data

Industry Sectors involved: incl. primary ‘end users’

Margin Payments
• Both the debtor and creditor are Fis.
• Settlement takes place via the HVPS
• The CCP can play the role of the debtor or creditor.
• The CCP is always the instructing agent for credits
transfers and debit instructions
• The transfer has certain target settlement times (e.g.
before 8am EST)

Settlement Time Request

Central counterparty settlements and margin payments

•

End User
• Debtor: FI and participant in a CCP
• Creditor: FI and participant in a CCP

Till Time

Codewords (immutability)
• Category Purpose Code indicating CCP margin
transactions
• Purpose Code to indicate a sub-type (various codes exit
already: CCPC, CCPM, CCSM

Priority Request
• High
Conclusions/ Recommendations

Target Benefits (from effective market guidance)

Challenges in providing Guidance for the Use Case
The correct message to instruct the debit is the pacs.010.
Unfortunately, the CBPR+ version of the pacs.010 does not
support the instruction priority and category purpose. These
two elements will need to be made available

CCP as Creditor
• Timely execution of payment
• Tracking
• Apply payment automatically to the correct obligation
CCP Member as Debtor
• Not failing a margin call
• Not comingling client and house obligations
• tracking
Agent
• Easy identification of margin call in stress situations
