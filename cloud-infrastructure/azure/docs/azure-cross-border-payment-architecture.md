# Azure Enterprise Cross-Border Payment Architecture

## 🎯 Executive Overview

This document presents a comprehensive Azure-native implementation of the Level 0 Enterprise Cross-Border Payment Architecture, specifically designed for Tier 1 banks and FinTech organizations requiring enterprise-grade security, compliance, and scalability.

### 🏗️ Architecture Principles

- **Cloud-Native Design**: Built specifically for Azure services and capabilities
- **Enterprise Security**: Zero-trust architecture with Azure Active Directory integration
- **Financial Compliance**: PCI DSS Level 1, SOX, GDPR, and PMPG Use-Case 1a compliance
- **High Availability**: 99.95% uptime SLA with multi-region disaster recovery
- **Elastic Scaling**: Auto-scaling capabilities to handle peak transaction volumes
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay-as-you-scale model with reserved instance optimization
