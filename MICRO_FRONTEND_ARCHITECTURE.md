# Micro-Frontend Portal Architecture

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates both monolithic and micro-frontend architectural approaches:

1. **Monolithic Frontend** - Single bundled SPA with all features
2. **Micro-Frontend Portal** - Decomposed application with independent, domain-specific units

## Architecture Comparison

### Monolithic Frontend
- **Single Bundle**: All features in one application
- **Shared State**: Global state management across features
- **Unified Deployment**: Deploy entire application as one unit
- **Technology Stack**: Single tech stack for entire app

### Micro-Frontend Portal
- **Independent Deployments**: Each micro-frontend can be deployed separately
- **Domain Isolation**: Features organized by business domains
- **Technology Freedom**: Each team can choose their preferred stack
- **Team Autonomy**: Independent development and release cycles

## Micro-Frontend Benefits

1. **Team Autonomy**: Independent development cycles
2. **Technology Diversity**: Different frameworks per domain
3. **Scalable Development**: Parallel team development
4. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one micro-frontend don't affect others
5. **Independent Deployment**: Deploy features independently
6. **Domain-Driven Design**: Aligned with business domains

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Runtime Integration (Module Federation)
- Dynamic loading of micro-frontends
- Shared dependencies optimization
- Runtime composition

### 2. Build-Time Integration (Package-based)
- NPM packages for micro-frontends
- Shared build pipeline
- Static composition

### 3. Server-Side Integration (SSI/ESI)
- Server-side composition
- Edge-side includes
- Template-based integration
